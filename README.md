# PendelD
Hi guys, PenDelDCC is the lastest project of me. (www.wisselmotor.nl) it will take me some more month to complete, you can follow development here.
It will become a system for automated traincontrol. Up to two locomotives, 8 different routes (two directions) 4 switches, 8 stations, and 8 blocks. 
Further it wil control up to 16 signals (red/green) 
Everything controlled by DCC following the standards of the NMRA. 
Feel free to use (part off) the sketches. 
Thanks for reading,
Rob
